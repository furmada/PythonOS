Python OS 6 is the ultimate interface for touch-enabled microcomputers such as the Raspberry Pi. It offers a complete interface replacement, an application management and distribution system, and a UI toolkit for creating event-driven apps in Python.

The stable version OS currently supports a 240x320 display, while the development version supports any screen size.

Key features include:
* Application stack with support for threading, suspend, and app switch.
* UI components that include scrolling and dialogs.
* Event-driven callback programming that mixes the best of Python and Javascript.
* Color themes and icons that help you make beautiful, polished apps.
* Easy persistent storage.

## Get Started
### As a User

Simply download Python OS either on your computer (with Python and Pygame installed), or flash the disk image for your Pi (coming soon).

### As a Developer

Download and try out Python OS first.

Now, let's write a simple "Hello World" app.

Start by creating a folder titled "helloworld" under apps/.

In that folder, make two files, an `__init__.py` and an `app.json`.

The `app.json` file will contain:
```json
{
	"name": "helloworld",
	"title": "Hello World",
	"author": "Your_Name",
	"version": 1.0,
	"more": {
		"onStart": "hello"
	}
}
```

The `__init__.py` file will contain:
```python
import pyos

def hello(state, app):
	app.ui.addChild(pyos.GUI.Text((5, 5), "Hello World!"))
```

- Now, enter the About app and ***long press*** the "Start State Shell" button to launch the Debug App Bind feature.
- Open your app's folder, then press the green dot button to select it and associate the app with the system.
